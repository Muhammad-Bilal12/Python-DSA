Why python?

python was created in 1989 before java

1- Design Philosophy
2- Batteries Included (Do not reinvent the wheel)
3- General Purpose (procedural - Functional - OOP Language)
4- Library/Community
  
Why python for Data Science?

- Easy to learn
- Proximity with maths
- Community

*numpy is design in c language which makes python fast

## Lets Start Python
-- Practice in google colab
* python is case sensitive language.

x() -- means its a function 
1. program "Hello World" -- google colab
print("text")

## Data Types
- Integer
- Float/Decimal
- Complex (real + imaginary)
- Boolean
- Text/String
- Array -> C -> List
- Tuple 
- Sets
- Dictionary

type() function which return data type

## Variable

- Variable is used to store data 
a = "bilal" # syngtax of variable

- Interviw Question
* Dynamic Typing --> auto understand type
* Static Typing --> where we define data type like c/c++
* Dynamic Binding --> we can always change data type at every point in python

## Comments
 - we used comments for developer to understand what we do in our code
two types of comment 
# Single Line Comment
''' MultiLine Comment '''

# Keywords and Identifier

- Compilation --> Process to convert souce code to binary language which understand by the machine
- Keywords --> words which has a specific meaning in python defined
* In python there are 32 keywords in python 

- Identifier --> Variable, Function name / variable naming convention rule
* special charater is not allowed except (_)
* keywords not allowed
* Don't start with number


## User Input
- input() # function helps to get input from user

* There are two types of software
-- static software -- not interact with user
-- dynamic software -- interact with user


* Why python take input in string data tyoe?
- String is universal data type which stores the every typte of value.


## Type Conversion

- Two Types of type conversion
- Implicit --> Compiler automatically convert the type like (small data convert to big data type)  
- Explicit --> Forcefully convert big data to small data type
* several methods to explicit type conversion

str to int
int() --> convert to data into integer
* can't convert complex to integer

int to str
str()

and so on...

## Literals
- value which store in variable
integer literals
0b --> number in binary literals
0o --> number in octal literals
0x --> number in hexadecimal literals

float literals
complex literals
String Literals
Unicode Literals
Escape sequence in String Literals

- None Literals --> Empty
a = None

in python we cannot declare variabele without value

boolean literals
* boolean also trets like a number in mathmatical expression

# Lecture 2

Topics:
- Operators
- IF Else
- loops


## Operator
Arithmetic Operators (+, -, *, /, [Integer Division //],  [moduus %], [power of **], )
Relational Operators (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=)
Logical Operators (and &&, or ||, not !)
Bitwise Operators 
Assignment Operators 
Membership Operators 


### bitwise Operator -- which operates on binary number

- bitwise and (&) [binary addition]
- bitwise or (|) [bitwise product]
- bitwise xor (^) [same = 0 , differnt = 1 ]
- bitwise not (~) [inverse]
- left shift ( >> ) [shift 2 bit on left]
- right shift (<<) [shift 2 bit on right]


### Assignment Operator

- assignment operator = 

### Membership Operator

available or not
- in
- not in

*** Program to find the sum of 3 digit number enter by the user?

## IF Else

- Conditional statement
- branching on the program
*** program to make a login authentication
*** find to make max and min of 3 numbers
*** Make a calculator program (menu driven number)

## Modules in python

- a python fole which already has some function which we used in our programs
- math  (for perform mathmethical operation)
- keywords (generate keyword list)
- random (for generate random number)
- datetime (for current date and time)

help('modules') --> print all modules which are available in python

## Loops
- repeatition 
- Whilee loop
- while loop with else
- for loop

** python tutor for learning purpose

Problems
** guessing game

- range(1,11) --> to generate number
